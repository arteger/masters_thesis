\section*{Abstract}

This thesis considers the problem of search the maximum independent set in an undirected graph. An independent set is a group of vertices where no two vertices are neighboring. A lot of real life problems in biochemistry,  converge to max independent search and thus creating efficient algorithm is a challenging and multipurpose task. To date, there is no effective algorithm for locating the most independent sets. In contrast to the general greedy methods for MIS, evolutionary algorithms, supervised learning neural networks, we want to provide a dataless neural network algorithm based only on the graph structure and that does not require training data. We also provide algorithms for large graphs reducton based on communities detection and a few preprocessing and postprocessing tecnhics for reducing graph cardinality and improving result of the neural network. Our model performs on average with 90 \% accuracy comparing to existing state-of-art methods but generates sub-optimal result exponentially faster than other solvers so it can be used for getting sub-optimal solutions on large graphs.
