  abstract  = "The representation of chemical and biological molecules by means
               of graphs permits the use of a maximum common subgraph (MCS)
               isomorphism algorithm to identify the structural relationships
               existing between pairs of such molecular graphs. Clique
               detection provides an efficient way of implementing MCS
               detection, and this article reports a comparison of several
               different clique-detection algorithms when used for this
               purpose. Experiments with both small molecules and proteins
               demonstrate that the most efficient of these particular
               applications, which typically involve correspondence graphs with
               low edge densities, is the algorithm described by Carraghan and
               Pardalos. This is shown to be two to three times faster than the
               Bron-Kerbosch algorithm that has been used previously for MCS
               applications in chemistry and biology. However, the latter
               algorithm enables all substructures common to a pair of
               molecules to be identified, and not just the largest ones, as
               with the other algorithms considered here. The two algorithms
               can usefully be combined to increase the efficiency of
               database-searching systems that use the MCS as a measure of
               structural similarity.",

    abstract = "{Motivation: The methods for analyzing overlap data are distinct
  from those for analyzing probe data, making integration of the two
  forms awkward. Conversion of overlap data to probe-like data
  elements would facilitate comparison and uniform integration of
  overlap data and probe data using software developed for analysis of
  STS data.Results: We show that overlap data can be effectively converted
  to probe-like data elements by extracting maximal sets of mutually
  overlapping clones. We call these sets virtual probes ,
  since each set determines a site in the genome corresponding to the
  region which is common among the clones of the set. Finding the
  virtual probes is equivalent to finding the maximal cliques of a
  graph. We modify a known maximal-clique algorithm such that it finds
  all virtual probes in a large dataset within minutes. We illustrate
  the algorithm by converting fingerprint and Alu-PCR overlap data to
  virtual probes. The virtual probes are then analyzed using
  double-linkage intersection graphs and structure graphs to show that
  methods designed for STS data are also applicable to overlap data
  represented as virtual probes. Next we show that virtual probes can
  produce a uniform integration of different kinds of mapping data, in
  particular STS probe data and fingerprint and Alu-PCR overlap data.
  The integrated virtual probes produce longer double-linkage contigs
  than STS probes alone, and in conjunction with structure graphs they
  facilitate the identification and elimination of anomalies. Thus,
  the virtual-probe technique provides: (i) a new way to examine
  overlap data; (ii) a basis on which to compare overlap data and
  probe data using the same systems and standards; and (iii) a unique
  and useful way to uniformly integrate overlap data with probe
  data.Availability: Freely available on request.Contact: eharley@cs.toronto.edu}",

abstract = {Given a graph G=(V,E), the independent set problem is that of finding a maximum-cardinality subset S of V such that no two vertices in S are adjacent. We introduce two fast local search routines for this problem. The first can determine in linear time whether a maximal solution can be improved by replacing a single vertex with two others. The second routine can determine in O(mΔ) time (where Δ is the highest degree in the graph) whether there are two solution vertices than can be replaced by a set of three. We also present a more elaborate heuristic that successfully applies local search to find near-optimum solutions to a wide variety of instances. We test our algorithms on instances from the literature as well as on new ones proposed in this paper.},
